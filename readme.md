## Overview

This app simulates a reddit inspired forum usable by dalhousie students. its purpose is to act as a social media with post submissions and indiviudal messaging.
Users can create their own accounts and login it uses regex expressions to securely create users and then hashes to ensure no potential information leaks
At all points in which users enter thier data it gets scrubbed to be safe of any intentional or unintentiional malware to the sytem.
All posts will be shown on the home page of the media and any posts made by the logged in user can be edited or deleted.
Any Person can see the post's though only users with an account can properly interact with the website.


## Testing & Use Cases

Throughoput the Development Process I used my personal GitHub to benefit from version control, I also tested and pushed after each function or feature implimented.
I found that th biggest issue that would arise would be features that interact with the database directly.
Additionally the best debugger was the simple ol reliable console.log.
